# Arthropod-Taxonomy-Orders-Object-Detection

Species identification from an image is a complex problem. Image classification assumes there is only one species in the image. But generally we want to identify ALL species present in an image. Thankfully, biologists and taxonomists have systematically classified and ordered organisms in a taxonomic hierarchy. The ArTaxOr data set covers arthropods, which includes insects, spiders, crustaceans, centipedes, millipedes etc. There are more than 1.3 million species of arthropods described. Creating a single dataset to cover all those is not feasible. However, the identification problem can be broken down into multiple tasks, starting with object detection at order level (there are >120 orders of arthropods), then followed by family classification and finally species classification.
